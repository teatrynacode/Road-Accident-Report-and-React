The growing number of traffic accidents in Malaysia poses a serious threat to public safety, from 1990 to 2011, the overall number of accidents in Malaysia grew annually, with a 70% increase in deaths resulting from traffic accidents.
 The current accident reporting system's reliance on manual procedures is one of its main
 flaws. Because these procedures rely on human witnesses or victims who may be incompetent or
 confused, they are frequently inefficient and prone to mistakes. Because of this dependence,
 there are considerable delays in reporting incidents, which further postpone the arrival of rescue
 personnel.
