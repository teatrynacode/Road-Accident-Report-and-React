The growing number of traffic accidents in Malaysia poses a serious threat to public safety, from 1990 to 2011, the overall number of accidents in Malaysia grew annually, with a 70% increase in deaths resulting from traffic accidents.
The current accident reporting system's reliance on manual procedures is one of its mainflaws. Because these procedures rely on human witnesses or victims who may be incompetent or confused, they are frequently inefficient and prone to mistakes. Because of this dependence, there are considerable delays in reporting incidents, which further postpone the arrival of rescue personnel.

In order to overcome these difficulties, the "Road Accident Report and React" system isbeing suggested. It uses sophisticated coding techniques to automate the extraction, analysis, and visualisation of accident data. This approach attempts to offer a comprehensive and up-to-date summary of traffic accidents by concentrating on important factors including the kind of vehicle involved, the date and time of the accidents, and the state of the roads at the time of events. By using a data-driven strategy, the government would be able to make better decisions, enhance traffic safety protocols, and eventually lower the frequency and severity of traffic incidents in Malaysia.

Our objectives for this project:
* To create an accident record using data structure.
* To sort the accident records from newest to oldest by using Quick sort.
* To search the accident record based on Year, Type of Vehicle, Road Conditions and Time of the Day using linear search.
* To display accident details and notify the accident report to the responsible higher authorities.
